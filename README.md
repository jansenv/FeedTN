This was my .NET capstone for Nashville Software School's Full-Stack Software Development program, which I regrettably did not provide documentation on at the time.

The 'idea' was a kind of hypothetical government app for meal delivery for schoolchildren during COVID, an idea which was not originally mine but I had decided to implement after fellow student Guy Cherkesky pitched it to me.

I'm still very proud of it and it had a lot of fun features, like signing the user up for text updates via Twilio.

I actually modeled it to use the same styling as Tennessee's government websites did at the time, and I even managed to deploy it briefly as a live website using Azure.
